# Web Scraper (Learning Project)

This is a Python project where I am learning web scraping by building a script myself.  
Gemini AI was used as a guide to generate code examples and explain how the script works, helping me understand each step.

## About This Project
The goal is to practice Python programming, understand web scraping techniques, and improve my automation skills.  
This is a learning project — not production-ready — and documents my growth.

## What It Does
- Extracts data from websites into CSV files  
- Demonstrates Python scripting and basic automation  
- Shows step-by-step learning through experimentation

## Work in Progress
- Better error handling  
- Support for scraping multiple sites  
- Code cleanup and optimization  

## How to Try It
If you want to try this project yourself, these are the commands you would use in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/abrahamtemitayo06-hash/Web-scraper.git  
pip install -r requirements.txt  *(only if you have a requirements file with dependencies)*  
python Web_scraper.py

> Note: This project is mainly for learning purposes. The commands above are for guidance if you want to experiment with it.

## Learning Goal
To understand Python, web scraping, and automation concepts, while documenting the learning process and experimenting with real code.
## Changelog
- v0.1: Initial learning project with Web_scraper.py
- v0.2: Organized files into scripts/ and data/ folders
